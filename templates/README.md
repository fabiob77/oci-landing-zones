# Templates for each Landing Zone

This templates directory holds the base composition modules(templates) for our 
Enterprise Landing Zone. These templates consist of individual definitions of our 
intended OELZ configuration. As they are individual entries they can be combined or 
iterated over to allow for creation of multiple infrastructure pieces. The [enterprise-landing-zone](./enterprise-landing-zone/) directory 
contains the template for Oracle Enterprise Landing Zone v2.
